Hey guys, let's team up on this next time!

As the week goes along, there will be a zip on Slack with a project directory just like this.

Volunteers can add problems and specs to it as the week goes.
  Just post in the Slack channel to "claim" a problem.
  Write a solution and specs.
  Download and reupload the zip with your solution and specs.
  Also don't forget to add the problem to the "skeleton" lib.

Thanks to those of you who contributed to this project in Slack and through the Google email group!

Happy studying!
